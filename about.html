      <div class="about-text">
        CapsuleX is a safe space for sending anonymous messages to people you care about. A place to express what words often leave unsaid.
        Whether it’s love, appreciation, a thank you, or something you’ve always wanted to share — CapsuleX delivers it anonymously and sincerely.
        We never store your message contents. Just the act of expression, nothing else.<br>
        <span class="italic-muted">Stay curious. Stay kind.</span>

        <h2 class="about-me-heading">About the Developer</h2>

        <p class="about-paragraph">
          Kevin Antony — developer, designer, and poet (formally known as Kevin Hayrle). As he stepped into his second-year of a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Kevin built <strong>CapsuleX</strong> as his first full-stack web application — a fun project that became something more. He grew up watching how hard it is for people to confess their feelings, say what they really mean, or open up honestly. That emotional weight stayed with him.
        </p>

        <p class="about-quote">
          So he created a space for it.<br>
          A place to write without fear.<br>
          To send without being seen.<br>
          To say what’s been unsaid.
        </p>

        <div class="capsule-tagline">
          Write it. Capsule it. <span class="grey-x">X</span> sends it.
